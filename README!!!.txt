ZEUS is an artificially intelligent ChatBot made with NLP and Neural Network, by Ishan Sandeep Kshirsagar, 
a student of SCOE, Pune who is a basic level Python coder.

**TO GET STARTED**

1) Make sure you've downloaded all 11 files, i.e :
__pycache__, app, chat, data, intents, model, nltk_utils, README!!!, train, ZEUS - The ChatBot and zeus.png.

2) Simply run the ZEUS - The ChatBot.exe file, and you're good to go!

3) After clicking the .exe file, it may show some Error. Kindly ignore it, close it and wait for the app to open.

**ABOUT THE BOT**

Zeus is still a learning bot, hence he may tend to make mistakes for which he, and me, humbly apologize for.
